<!-- Why/Motivation -->
## Limit the Width of the Main Content and Centralize It on Big Monitors

On occasion of using a big monitor, it's becoming uncomfortable for you to read the content in long lines and it is likely that you are going to limit the width of the main content and then centralize it. 


<!-- Why/Motivation -->
## Hide of the Navigation (and Header if Needed) on Small Monitors

Sometimes when using a small monitor, we are going to hide the navigation to make more spaces for the main content.
